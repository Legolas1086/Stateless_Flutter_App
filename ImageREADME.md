To usr a custom image we have to first create a directory of any name 
and then add the image to this directory. Then we have to update this in the 
pubspec.yaml file. The image part will be commented, so remove the comment
and remove the example images and add the path of your image as
- directory_name/image_name and use this whereever needed
